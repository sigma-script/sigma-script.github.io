create a mimic language using pygame where the user can type "sigma(example)" to create text. they also can type "variable(example)" to create a variable with a number or letter after it. if the user wants to change the variable they have the command "question(variable)(name a number)" and what the user input would be the variable. the user could also type "add 1 to variable" to increase the variable by 1. all the inputs and outputs are in the pygame window. add a command called "clear" to clear the window of any previous outputs. add the ">" symbol before the users text
